# FDF 
This is a project of the cursus of ecole 42. 
The goal is to write a small graphic application capable of representing a 3D-Projection of a wire grid using the graphics library minilibx (https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux)
Build the application like this 
```
make all
```
and run it as followed:
```
./fdf [path_to_map]
```

An examplemap is located in ./map

# Tests
The code is NOT unit tested since I did not know how to properly test graphics using the test framework criterion (https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion). 
CODING WITHOUT TESTING IS A PAIN.
